# 👋 Hey there, I'm Svxqevix

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and PHP. I enjoy building websites that I can eventually evolve into full software applications, that have organised code and interfaces that are meaningful. I also enjoy that satisfaction of fixing bugs and solving those frustrating problems that stop things from running properly

I'm always looking to improve, experiment and create things that people can use!

### 🛠️ Current Tools & Tech
These are the languages and tools I'm working with most often right now:
- Python - My go-to for building applications and messing around with ideas!
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript - For Shaping out responsive UIs and Code Validation.
- PHP - Just enough to make a database for Registers / Logins..
- VS Code - Where all the magic happens.
- Git & Github - Tracking progress and making history!

### 📚 What I am learning
University covers a lot, but I'm also teaching myself things as I go along:
- Better UI/UX Design - Making sure apps run smoothly and look modern.
- Frontend Frameworks - Exploring React and others to build more up to date websites.
- Code Structure - Naming and organising complex code so it actually makes sense later on.
